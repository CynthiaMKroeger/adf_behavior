This repository contains supporting materials for the manuscript that describes our work evaluating the Effects of Alternate Day Fasting versus Daily Calorie Restriction on Dietary Restraint, Self-efficacy, and Appetite. 


## Description of Repository Contents 

The types of supporting materials in this repository include: 

* .R files with code for multiple imputation methods, statistical analyses, and figure generation
* .csv files of all SAS results 
* .pdf files of surveys used 
* .txt file with licensing information


## .R files 

__File names for, descriptions of, and authors of all R code used for this project:__

imputation.R

* This file contains the code used to impute missing data. 
* Authors: Hiroki Naganobori, Cynthia M Kroeger


clean_imputed_data.R

* This file contains the code used to clean the imputed dataset. 
* Author: Cynthia M Kroeger


LMEModelSummary.R
ImpLMEModelSummary.R

* These files contain the code used to define the imputation synthesis model terms for the longitudinal study design. 
* Author: Hiroki Naganobori


imputation_model.R

* This file contains the code used to run statistical models on the full imputed dataset. 
* Authors: Hiroki Naganobori, Cynthia M Kroeger


baseline_statistics.R

* This file contains the code used to run baseline analyses that are presented in Table 1 of the manuscript.
* Authors: Chen Lyu, Cynthia M Kroeger


figures.R

* This file contains the code used to generate figures. Outputs used to generate figures were obtained from statistical analyses completed in SAS, with methods described in manuscript. 
* Authors: Chen Lyu, Cynthia M Kroeger


## A Note on How to Replicate this Study 
Because the data are clinical, they are not publicly available. A formal agreement with university ethics would need to be made to obtain the data. Further, longitudinal analyses were conducted using SAS, with the methods used described in the manuscript. All results from SAS are included in this repository to improve transparency and assist with any potential meta-analyses including this study. 

The main reasons for sharing .R code are to improve methods transparency and provide a potential resource for the field. When originally conducting the multiple imputation for this study, there were no clear methods for how to code the integration of analyses from all imputed data sets, for this kind of longitudinal design. Cynthia M Kroeger and Hiroki Naganobori scoured many written texts to work out the contents of ImpLMEModelSummary.R. Perhaps others may find the code useful to think about, replicate, and/or edit to accommodate their own analysis needs, if better resources are not already available.
